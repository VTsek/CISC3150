Disclaimer:

I'm learning how to commit and push Eclipse files to GitHub. 

During the process, I managed to run into error code 1D-10-T and managed to
overwrite all my homework files with blank folders, and had a backup version in my email.

Please be patient as I'm in the process of double checking and updating my homework files.
